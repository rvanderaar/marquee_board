# marquee_board

This is a test project for a retro Marquee board that I found in my collection
of hardware. It is based on multiple flip-flops cascaded and their outputs
driving LED's and the next flip-flop.

Before starting the program, make sure the PI GPIO deamon is running:

    sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
